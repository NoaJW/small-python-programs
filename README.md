# Small Python programs
This collection is a bunch of small Python programs that I've coded from the tasks given out in the programming books by Al Sweigart, mostly from the "The Big Book of Small Python Projects". 

These tasks can range from simple games, ciphers to automation. They are similar to LeetCode or other algorithmic practice platforms, hence I would do them from time to time to gain some confidence in coding and to train computational thinking.

The task URL is indicated at the top of each Python script. Try it out for yourself! 

## Run
1. Run the executable in the dist folder, or
2. Using a Python interpreter, run the Python script

## Tools
If you want to run the author's example code of the project, head over to the project page (URL stated at the top of the script), and copy-paste the code exactly (do not copy more lines above/below the code!) to a text file. 

The author's code is prefixed with indexing numbers. To remove them and format the code for the Python interpreter, run the **formatter.py** script under Tools folder.
